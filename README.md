# hsr-farming-route

Python script to farm all the mobs

Notes

-   Must not start script while on Space Station
-   Works better in fullscreen
-   Initiating combat seems to face camera post combat in direct of vector between enemy and character
-   Getting ambushed does not change camera angle post combat
-   Figure out more consistent method for roaming mobs

Things that break the script

-   Moving camera
-   Pressing buttons
-   Alt tabbing
-   Having any window that has Honkai window name (Discord text channels, websites etc)
